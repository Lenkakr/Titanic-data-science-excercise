# Titanic-data-science-excercise
Data analysis of survival factors on Titanic, based on Kaggle data set. I used this project as a first hands on experience with data science in Python. I analysed the data with Pandas and NumPy library, used Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualisations and Scikit-learn for machine learning (logistic regression).
